# SEP-3 Semester Project

This project is the culmination of the 3rd semester of a computer science program, focusing on the design and implementation of heterogeneous software solutions using Java and C#. The project involves integrating multiple programming languages across three tiers: a Blazor frontend, an ASP.NET backend, and a Java database tier that communicates with PostgreSQL.

The ASP.NET backend communicates with the Blazor frontend via REST, while communicating with the Java tier using gRPC. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive, real-world understanding of software design and development, and to prepare students for careers in the industry.
